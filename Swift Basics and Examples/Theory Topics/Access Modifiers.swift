import Foundation

//Open — This is where you can access all data members and member functions within the same module(target) and outside of it. You can subclass or override outside the module(target).

//        Public — This is the same as open, the only difference is you can’t subclass or override outside the module(target).

//        Internal — This is the default access level in Swift, it allows all data members and member functions to be accessed within the same module(target) only and restrict access outside the module(target).

//        Private — This is where you can access data members and function within its enclosing declaration as well as an extension within the same file. It does not allow access in a subclass with in the same file or in another file.

//        File-private - This is the same as private, the only difference is it allows access in a subclass with in the same file.
