//In Shallow copy, a copy of the original object is stored and only the reference address is finally copied.

//In Deep copy, the copy of the original object and the repetitive copies both are stored.

//Stack is used for static memory allocation and Heap for dynamic memory allocation, both stored in the computer's RAM .

//For reference types, the reference is stored on the stack while the object it refers to is stored on the heap. For value types, the object itself is stored on the stack.
